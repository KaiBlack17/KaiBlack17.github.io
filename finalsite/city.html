        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Located in the southern end of Salt Lake Valley, the first people of European descent to live in the area that is now Riverton settled in the mid-1850s.
            These early settlers scattered widely along the river bottom in crude dugout homes.
            Although the early accounts disagree, Archibald Gardner may have been the first to settle Riverton land.
            The town was originally referred to as “Gardnerville” prior to changing its name to Riverton.
            Riverton's initial growth was slow because of the lack of water for irrigation. When more water became available, the town began to grow.
            Eventually three canals were built to extend water from the nearby Jordan River to the benchland areas, providing irrigation for agricultural uses to the larger area.
            By the beginning of World War I in 1914, with its additional irrigation water and influx of people, Riverton prospered as an agricultural community.
            Its thriving business district was also evident at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Farming was a major Riverton business. Just before the turn of the century, the farmers in Riverton gradually began to change from self-sufficient farming to commercial farming.
            In its early years Riverton's farmers were mostly self-sufficient, producing almost everything they needed.
            This was no longer the case when farming became a business.
            Riverton farmers were becoming specialists concentrating mostly on alfalfa, wheat, sugar beets, tomatoes, poultry, sheep or dairy cows.
