        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>Teens through seniors, anyone who wants to check the weather for planning purposes or even just to know what to wear for the day.</p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Karey is 42 years old, and is on the city council. She needs to know the weather so that she can plan city events</li>
                <li>Rhett is a 17 year old senior in high school, he likes to look at the site on days that he's bored so that he can find fun events in the area, and he checks it every day before school for recommendations on what he should wear before walking to school.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Five Scenarios</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sally is attending an outdoor wedding reception in three days and wants to know what length of dress to buy for the occasion. She checks this website and sees that in three days it's supposed to be cold, so she buys a longer dress and stays warm throughout the event.</li>
                <li>Bobert is planning an outdoor fundraiser event and wants the weather to be hot so that children can have fun playing in sprinklers. He also wants to bring awareness to the event, so he finds the hottest day in summer and posts an ad on the site for his event, then lots of people show up.</li>
                <li>Tod is an Amazon delivery person and runs outside a lot, so he needs to know what to wear each day. He checks this site every day first thing in the morning, and it gives him accurate predictions on what he should wear.</li>
                <li>Hannah wants to do something fun on a snowy day, so she visits the site and gets recommendations on what to wear. She also sees that there's going to be a giant community snowball fight at noon, and decides to go.</li>
                <li>Fred's friends want to go to an amusement park and are urging him to buy his non-refundable tickets online early, but Fred has the good sense to check this site first. He finds out that there is supposed to be a major thunderstorm on the day they planned on, so he doesn't buy the tickets and waste his money like his friends did.</li>
            </ol>
